# Explaining the $5 Word and it's Relevance

"Virgule" is the academic term for the / character when used in English.  When you write things like "every time an employee clocks in for work, he/she must report to his/her supervisor", those /'s are considered "virgules".  This word is hardly ever used and using it will likely get you thrown out of parties if you ever do explain it.  The only reason I know that the word exists is because I was trying to show off at work to someone who got their bachelor's of English.  After using "with/out" on a work email, the recipient called me up and asked what I meant by it.  After explaining it's use, they responded with "Ooo, that's vulgar".

# Elegant, not Vulgar

I'm a huge fan of condensing down information when you don't lose clarity.  If there was ever vote to make the [Interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang) an official symbol, I would be all for it.  That is why when I read the shortened word "s/he", which is a substitute for "she/he", I fell in love!  The author (and I wish I could give this person credit but don't remember where I read this) would split one word into two when they could.  "She/he" becomes "s/he", "with/without" becomes "with/out", and "do/don't" becomes "do/n't" with this system.  To me, this is an elegant use of symbols since it removes an entire word from a side of the / without losing the word it's eliminating.

So I'm trying to spread the word (or lack of word) and attempt to make this more popular.  If [YOLO can be added to the dictionary](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37336564) simply because enough people use it, then there's no reason this "vulgar use of virgules" can't become official if enough of us agree.  Remember, using "I'm" to shorten "I am" wasn't always in our language.
