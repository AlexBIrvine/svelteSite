"What character is everyone else playing?"

That is the question that is usually asked first when the GM asks someone if they want to join their game.  For some people, this question is to make sure they are contributing to the party balance.  If the group is lacking a healer or a tank, maybe they will pick up the role of Cleric or Paladin.  For other people however, they want to make sure they are not building the same character as someone else.  If the group already has the person who's good at close quarters combat, why build another one?  Why have two of the same character in a small party?  

For me, that is the failure of a system's character creation.  Just as there are many different ways to solve a problem, there should be many different ways to build a character for a role.  Let's look at the "basic" sword fighter as an example.  In Dire RPG, there are three main sections to the character sheet: attributes, skills, and their course knowledge.  Attributes make up how strong, fast, durable, and smart someone is.  Skills determine how likely they are to succeed at a certain action.  Course knowledge represent the new abilities they learn during their studies.  A sword fighter who focuses on increasing their strength attribute could be the muscular barbarian who wields a massive hunk of sharp metal they call a sword.  They might not swing often, or hit often, but when they do they cleave through whatever was in their way.  Alternatively, a fencer who focuses all their time training their skill and not their strength could only wield light rapiers, but they rarely miss.  Death by a thousand cuts.  Lastly, a sword fighter who hits the books hard might have many tricks up their sleeves to overcome their opponent.  They could learn to parry an incoming attack, use their opponents momentum against them, shove them off balance, knock their weapon out of their hand, and catch it.  Zorro anybody?  

With this system, I just described three very different characters all taking up the role of "sword fighter".  If these three characters decided to focus on blunt weapons like maces and hammers instead, we could easily have six different characters that make up the "melee fighter".  This doesn't even touch the diversity that comes when considering the different way to intact with magic.  By dropping class based systems, and allowing the character to invest XP in every individual stat they wish to improve, I believe that Dire RPG will be a system that allows the player to fine tune exactly the character they want to play at character creation and beyond.
