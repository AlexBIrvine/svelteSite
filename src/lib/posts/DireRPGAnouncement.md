Any long time TTRPG player has been where I am.  You are playing your game in your current favorite system, someone at the table wants to do something cool, but you quickly realize the game was not built for that.  These types of moments are what I refer to as the "but moment" for the game master.  They can very from lacking rules, rules that are there but make no sense, or even reasons why the system as a whole isn't a great as it could be. For me, a forever GM that has been playing since the early days of Dungeons and Dragons 3.0, I have many personal "but moments".  

The fighter at the table just kicked the orc down a flight of stairs, but the game doesn't have rules for how to calculate damage.  
The wizard wants to create water inside mouth of the charging barbarian, but that creative use of a low level spell would break encounters.  
I want to build a character that does X Y and Z, but that would require me to multiclass in X Y and Z.  

Branching out to other lesser played systems did not give me the answer I was looking for either.  Shadowrun has the coolest setting and a unique priority system when building a character, but the d6 dice pool mechanic is cumbersome to play.  Fate allows you to die during character creations, but it allows you to die within character creations.  No, the more I looked at other systems, the more I realized I was just fining more "but moments" to complain about.  

So what is a very picky player to do except make their own system!  After work shopping with my close friends off and on for a few years, I've finally come up with the system I wish already existed.  At the time of writing this, I'm 40 pages in on the creation of the first core rule book for the system I'm naming Dire RPG (a name I can't believe isn't already taken).  While I'm writing it out and before it's released, I will post updates on the game's design philosophy, the particular mechanics it will have, and teasers of the setting and lore.  For those who are interested in following it's progress, please keep an eye on the `Dire RPG` category in the blog of this website.
