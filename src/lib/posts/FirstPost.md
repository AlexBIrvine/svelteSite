# Hello World!

Such a unique start to a programming project huh?  Well, I couldn't think of better and knew that I would delete (or archive) this later, so why not start in the most unoriginal way ever?  
This is my new website that I made with the help of a fantastic gentleman [Josh Collinsworth](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/) who made the starter template for this site.  As of writing and publishing this post, I am pretty much using everything as he made but have many plans on dissecting this skeleton of a site and making it my own.  

# So What Will You Do With This Site? 
First and foremost, I will be changing up the style that shipped with the template.  Currently it looks like this: 

![Site Look](/images/siteLook.png)

And I hate it! It's bright, has large fonts by default, and has a red underline for it's accent color.  This is not my style at all.  And darn it, if I'm going to have to pay for my server and domain space, I am going to make this look just how I want it to look!  

As far as content, I plan on:
- Blogging about my viewpoints on technology, software, philosophy, etc.,  
- Code snippets and the explanation behind them.   
- A learning journal to explain processes to myself and others.  
- How to articles for topics not found easily online.  
- A Gemini space for the smolweb.  
- The ability for the reader to change the theme, [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) style!
- Hosting files for my programming projects. 
- Updates to Dire RPG. 

# How Long Until It's All Ready?
No idea!  I'm not really good at time tables, nor have I really done this before.  I'm just happy that I have this up and running in the first place and it only took me a few hours!  

Until then, I'm going to hopefully update this as I go and post the updates as I go for my own keepsake.
