# Learning Journal

This section will soon be updated with notes taken for the various subjects I am studying. I'm a fan of journaling and like to apply it to the learning process so I can see my comprehension of various subjects in real time. I find that the best learning sources online for programming is not only the source code, but the thoughts behind the source code. This allows me to have a written record of why I'm committing the code that I do, which can help me spot incorrect thinking when reviewing it in the future.

Soon I'll add a sidebar to this page for a table of contents based organization.
