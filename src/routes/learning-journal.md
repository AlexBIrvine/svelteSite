# Learning Journal

This page is temporarily under construction while I work out how I want the entries to be organized.  I am toying around in my head with different designs, all which will have to have their own api made for them.

In the mean time, the journal entries are being hosted in the blog section with the category tag `Learning Journal`.  You can [click this link](https://www.6pakal.com/blog/category/Learning%20Journal) if you wish to be taken to the sorted view only containing those entries.  

Thank you for your patience as I learn how to make a proper full stack web app.
