# About Me

6 Pak AL is a technology obsessed programming nerd based in the USA who dabbles in too many areas to have one focus.

# Technologies Used on this Site

This site is currently operating a [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) on a $5/month VPS hosted by [VULTR](https://www.vultr.com/), and built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

The codebase started as a [template project](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter) created by the wonderful [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/) and has been heavily modified from there. I aimed to create a project that allowed me to write markdown files and have the site automatically convert them into pages, utilize YAML metadata to easily organize the posts by date and category, style the site with SASS, use site wide CSS variables for allowing user customized layouts, and host the blog as a RSS feed. Somehow, the template achieved 90% of this and made it very easy to modify. Although I'm not a fan of his styling (as explained in [this post](https://www.6pakal.com/blog/FirstPost)), I am amazed by how clean his codebase is and highly recommend anyone curious to check out his site and github.

# Contact Me

I'm still debating if I want to put my email here or provide links to social media.  I'm a person that likes to compartmentalize different parts of my area.  As the old Futurama joke goes:
