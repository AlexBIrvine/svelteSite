# How to Contact Me

You can't ;)

In all honesty though, I'm going to eventually update this area with a contact form that will send a POST request to my sever and run a program that emails me. I also want to figure out which social network platforms I want to be publicly available on. I value anonymity for this online handle and do not want to link it to myself in real life.
