- Created sidebar, but it only looks good on desktop.  Need to figure out how I want this to look on mobile.  
- The categories in the sidebar are not being sorted by title.  They seem to be sorting by how the order they are showing up in the journal entries themselves, but I have no way of debugging that with my current skill set.
